# Contributing to `next.jdbc`

Feel free to [open Issues](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/issues) with opinions
and suggestions -- I'm happy to have discussions about any aspect of the library!

I welcome Pull Requests for source code changes *that are accompanied by tests*, and for documentation changes. For any substantial change, please open an issue for discussion first, or find me in the `#sql` stream on Clojurians Zulip or the `#sql` channel on Clojurians Slack to chat about it.

In particular, as of 1.0.0 Beta 1, no breaking changes will be entertained. All future changes must either be purely accretive or purely fixative.
