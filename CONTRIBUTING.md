# Contributing to `next.jdbc`

The next generation of [`clojure.java.jdbc`](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc)
is *still not accepting contributions* because it I have not yet decided
whether it will become a Contrib project (like `clojure.java.jdbc`)
or whether it will continue to be a public, open source project.

Please do not send Pull Requests at this point!

Feel free to [open Issues](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/issues) with opinions
and suggestions -- I'm happy to have discussions about any aspect of the library!
