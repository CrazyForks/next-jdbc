# next.jdbc

The next generation of [`clojure.java.jdbc`](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc)
is *not yet accepting contributions* because it is exploratory work and I do
not know yet whether it will be a Contrib project (like `clojure.java.jdbc`)
or whether it will be a public, open source project.

Please do not send Pull Requests at this point!

Feel free to [open Issues](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/issues) with opinions
and suggestions -- I'm having to have discussions about the concepts!
