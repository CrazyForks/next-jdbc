# Contributing to `next.jdbc`

Feel free to [open Issues](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/issues) with opinions and suggestions -- I'm happy to have discussions about any aspect of the library!

I welcome Pull Requests for source code changes *that are accompanied by tests*, and for any documentation changes. For any substantial change, please open an issue for discussion first, or find me in the `#sql` stream on Clojurians Zulip or the `#sql` channel on Clojurians Slack to chat about it.

In particular, **no breaking changes will be entertained**. All future changes must either be purely accretive or purely fixative.
